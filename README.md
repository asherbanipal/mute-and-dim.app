# mute-and-dim.app
Mac app that mutes device, dims monitor(s), and turns OFF dock auto-hide. I wanted this is a quick way to prevent wandering eyes from seeing a screen while I RDP'ed into it. Also, I like the dock up so I can access apps more quickly. Volume off so that I don't distract anyone in range of the device.
